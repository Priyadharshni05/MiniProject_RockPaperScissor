## High Level Requirements

1.a
2.The necessary header files must be added to perform dynamic memory allocation, standard input/output functions, structures, pointers, looping statements such as for, while, switch-case, if and else-if ladder.


## Low Level Requirements

1. The header files required for the project are as follows
   * <stdio.h> - to make use of stadard input/output functions
   * <string.h> - to make use of string functions
   * <stdlib.h> - for dynamic memory allocation, pointers and system functions for the console widow
   * <time.h> - for manipulating time
   * <ctype.h> - to make use of variables of char type to obtain inputs from the console window.
2. The user must input the choice in the same format as displayed in the console window as it is case sensitive.
3. Based on the choice of the user, the console must display the computer's choice and the winner of the game
